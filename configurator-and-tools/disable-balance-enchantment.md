### 2. Editing the packs with Editor

Both datapacks and mods contain the same things, but datapacks are particularly easy to modify without programming skills, as they consist of simple configuration files. This allows packs to be customized by modifying these files.&#x20;

See the Technical or Enchantment page for information on which files control what.
