If you have previously customized a datapack or mod using the enchantment configurator and wish to apply those same modifications to a newer version, you can use the dedicated update tool available at.<br>

### How to Use the Update Tool

The process is straightforward:

1. Upload Current Modified Pack: On the tool's interface (usually the left side), upload the datapack/mod file (.zip or .jar) that currently contains your custom configurations.
2. Upload Target Pack: On the other side (usually the right), upload the new version of the datapack/mod that you want to update your configurations onto.
3. Process: Initiate the update process using the tool's button. The tool will generate a new pack with your modifications applied to the target version.

### How It Works Under the Hood

When you modify a pack using the configurator, i**t doesn't just change the files**. It stores metadata about the specific actions you took (e.g., "changed Max Level I to II," "disabled enchantment X or Y," etc.) and the original values.

The update tool reads this stored history of actions from your pack. It then intelligently replays these same actions onto the new target pack you provided. It's essentially automating the process of you going back into the configurator and manually making all the same changes again on the new version.

### Do the File Formats Need to Match?

No, the input formats do not need to be identical.&#x20;

You can successfully update from a `.jar` file to a `.zip` file, or vice-versa. The tool handles the internal differences.
