# Welcome

## <mark style="color:orange;">Hello and welcome to the official wiki!</mark>

This wiki serves as the central knowledge base for the Minecraft content I've created. Here you'll find comprehensive information covering:

* **NeoEnchant**: Details on all the custom enchantments, how they work, and how to obtain them.
* **Yggdrasil**: Guides to the various structures added by the Yggdrasil pack, including locations, challenges, lore, and rewards.
* **Better Furnace:** Detailed crafts and information on the speed of each oven
* **Wispher of Ether:** Detailed information about this mod, its mechanics, runes, and other detailed information.
* **Web Tools:** Explanations and instructions for using the companion web utilities (Configurator, Updater, Converter) designed to help you manage and customize the packs.

My goal is to make this documentation as clear and helpful as possible.

If you find any information missing, unclear, or incorrect, please don't hesitate to let me know so I can improve it.

For discussions, questions, or just to chat, feel free to join the community on Discord.
