# Getting Started

## <mark style="color:orange;">Content</mark>

This is the Yggdrasil section. Here you will find detailed information about each structure, the Runic Dimension, legendary items, the Reva pet, and other related features introduced by the Yggdrasil pack.

## <mark style="color:orange;">Interactive Rewards Viewer</mark>

While this wiki describes the structures and challenges, a detailed and interactive viewer for the specific rewards obtainable within Yggdrasil structures is available on the main Yggdrasil presentation page over at Voxel

## <mark style="color:orange;">Download Links</mark>

Yggdrasil can be officially downloaded from Modrinth and CurseForge.&#x20;

If you find the pack available on any platform other than these two, please report it to me, as those are unauthorized distributors.&#x20;

Be cautious, as individuals who steal and re-upload content may introduce malware or other malicious elements into the files.
