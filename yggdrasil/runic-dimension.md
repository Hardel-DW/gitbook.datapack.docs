## <mark style="color:orange;">Accessing the Runic Dimension</mark>

The primary path to the Runic Dimension involves the Runic Island, which often requires completing steps tied to the Asflors village questline.

### The Quest Path:

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
Start in Asflors (Optionnal)

Locate an Asflors village. Initiate the quest. This questline is designed to eventually grant you the key needed to open the main entrance of the Runic Island.

[asflors-village.md](yggdrasil/structure/asflors-village.md "mention")
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Obtain the Runic Island Entrance Key

As part of the Asflors quest :

1. Locate the unique house with a green roof within the Asflors village.
2. Search the roof's foliage for a hidden chest. This chest contains both a treasure map leading to the Runic Island and the Rune of Breaking (the entrance key).
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Travel to the Runic Island:

Use the map to find the island floating in the sky. You can also find the Runic Island Stele for getting the map.

[runic-island.md](yggdrasil/structure/runic-island.md "mention")[steles.md](yggdrasil/structure/steles.md "mention")
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Enter the Runic Island

Use the Rune of Breaking on the sealed main entrance door.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### Figtht!

Inside the Runic Island, you'll likely encounter a trial spawner room. Defeating the monsters summoned here rewards you with a vault key _**(Key usable for another quest)**_

> _The key is related to the Asflors quest but not strictly necessary for reaching the Runic Dimension portal._
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
Find the Portal

After clearing the main combat area within the Runic Island, search trapdoors. These lead down to the chamber containing the active portal to the Runic Dimension. Enter the portal.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

### Alternative Entry (Secret Passages):

It is possible to _**bypass step three, four and five**_ by discovering one of the five secret passages leading into the Runic Island. These are hidden and finding them requires exploration.

This unique dimension hosts several distinct structures:

## <mark style="color:orange;">Exiting the Runic Dimension</mark>

There are two primary ways to return to the normal world:

1. Via a Runic Island: Copies of Runic Islands appear in the Runic Dimension at the exact same coordinates as their counterparts in the normal world. If you entered through a Runic Island, you can return to its dimensional counterpart and use the portal there.
   1. _Note: If you discovered secret passages on your first visit to the Overworld Runic Island, you can potentially use those same passages on the Runic Dimension version to bypass the entrance mechanism._
2. Via Dokkalfar Ruins: Locate Dokkalfar Ruins structures within the Runic Dimension. These small ruins contain active portals that lead back to the normal world.
