To obtain this sword, go to the central fountain and break the ground to go into the Asflors underground, which seems to harbor a strong energy.

#### Where to find the simple vault key (Orange) :&#x20;

These vaults, hidden within village houses, hold exclusive enchantments.\
To open them, you'll need a key. You can find one reliably at the village fountain, or you might get lucky searching the various pots scattered around the village.

#### Where to find the ominous vault key (Green) :

Follow the quest starting at the village lectern. Read the instructions, and head to the Runic Island – that's where the key awaits. For more specific directions, check the spoiler below.

So, you want the key without the quest, huh? Fair enough! Here's the shortcut:

1. Find the house with the green roof in the village (there's only one!). Hidden in the roof's foliage is a chest containing a treasure map to the Runic Island and the entrance key.
2. Travel to the structure shown on the map. Find the entrance door and use the Rune of Breaking from the chest to open it.
3. Prepare for a fight! Defeat the wave of monsters that appear. Your reward, the vault key, will drop from the Trial Spawner in the center of the room.
