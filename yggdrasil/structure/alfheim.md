Alfheim manifests as a colossal, vibrant pink tree gracing the world's surface, appearing randomly. As the very first structure developed for this world, it holds symbolic significance.<br>

## <mark style="color:orange;">Futur of Alfheim</mark>

While future updates plan to introduce unique rewards specific to Alfheim, it currently stands out as the structure offering the widest variety of loot, including a significant portion of the NeoEnchant enchantments.
