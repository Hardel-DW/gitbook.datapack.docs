# Getting Started

## <mark style="color:orange;">Introduction</mark>

This is the NeoEnchant section. Here you will find detailed information about each enchantment, as well as incompatibilities and other technical details.



## <mark style="color:orange;">Download Links</mark>

Better Furnace can be officially downloaded from Modrinth and CurseForge.&#x20;

If you find the pack available on any platform other than these two, please report it to me, as those are unauthorized distributors.&#x20;

Be cautious, as individuals who steal and re-upload content may introduce malware or other malicious elements into the files.
