## <mark style="color:orange;">Core Mechanics</mark>

**The Well System:**
- Each equipment has 300 Well points (durability)
- Applying runes consumes Well based on stat level and rune weight
- At 0 Well, equipment is locked and cannot be modified

**Success Outcomes:**
- **Critical Success** — Significant stat boost, no losses
- **Neutral Success** — Moderate boost, minor stat losses
- **Critical Failure** — No gains, heavy stat losses

**Trade-offs:**
- Improving one stat may reduce others
- Higher tier runes increase success chance but cost more Well
- Build strategically around the stats you need most
