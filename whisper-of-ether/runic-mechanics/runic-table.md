## <mark style="color:orange;">Forge Outcomes</mark>

When applying a rune, three outcomes can occur:

| Outcome | Effect |
| ------- | ------ |
| **Critical Success** ✨ | Statistics greatly enhanced |
| **Success** ✓ | Statistics improve, some may decrease |
| **Critical Fail** ✗ | Statistics don't improve, some decrease |

## <mark style="color:orange;">Well System</mark>

Each item has a **Well** that tracks remaining durability (starts at 300 points):

**Well Consumption:**
- Runes consume Well based on their **weight** and the **current stat level**
- Heavily upgraded stats cost more to modify
- More attributes on an item increase consumption cost

**Well Factor Effects:**
- At **100% Well** (0 cost): Maximum success chance
- At **50% Well**: Slight penalties apply
- Below **20% Well**: Significant failure rate increase
- At **0% Well**: Item is fully locked, cannot be modified

**Stat Caps:**
- Each stat has a maximum value that cannot be exceeded
- Reaching the cap blocks further modifications

## <mark style="color:orange;">Success Mechanics</mark>

**Critical Success** (highest reward):
- Significant stat increase from the rune
- No stat losses

**Neutral Success:**
- Moderate stat increase from the rune
- Minor random stat losses (10% penalty) from other attributes

**Critical Failure:**
- No stat gain from the rune
- Heavier random stat losses (20% penalty) from multiple attributes
