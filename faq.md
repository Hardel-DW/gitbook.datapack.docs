# Question and Answer for Datapacks

### <mark style="color:orange;">**Why doesn't NeoEnchant or Yggdrasil work after installing it on Realms?**</mark>

Experimental features on Realms servers are intentionally disabled by Mojang, including:

* Custom Biomes
* Custom Structures
* Custom Dimensions
* Custom World Generation
* Custom Armor Trims
* Enchantments
* Painting Variants
* Custom Discs

As a result, <mark style="color:red;">**NeoEnchant does not work on Realms**</mark><mark style="color:red;">,</mark> but it is fully supported in Singleplayer, Multiplayer, and on Fabric, Forge, NeoForge, Quilt, Paper, Bukkit... but not Realms.&#x20;

Yggdrasil, Should not also work in logic, to be confirmed. In the case of **BeyondEnchant**, this is an exception, as it modifies vanilla enchantments, which are not considered custom.

### <mark style="color:orange;">**Why doesn't the datapack reload with the**</mark><mark style="color:orange;">**&#x20;**</mark><mark style="color:orange;">**`/reload`**</mark><mark style="color:orange;">**&#x20;**</mark><mark style="color:orange;">**command?**</mark>

Because the features listed above are experimental, they do not allow reloading through the `/reload` command. You need to reload the world or restart the server for changes to take effect.

### <mark style="color:orange;">**Where can I find the datapacks?**</mark>

On Modrinth/CurseForge. This site allows you to financially support creators. If another platform does not point to Modrinth, it is most likely an illegal theft and could be dangerous to download. The only exceptions are this Discord and Github, which contains the source code.

### <mark style="color:orange;">**I found a bug, have a feature suggestion, or a balance request, what should I do?**</mark>

You have two options: make a request in the ⁠request-and-bugs channel or open a ticket on Github if you have an account.
